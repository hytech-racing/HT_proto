## Writing Documentation
PLEASE REFER TO THIS WHEN DOCUMENTING!

Messages, Fields, Services (and their methods), Enums (and their values), Extensions, and Files can be documented.
Generally speaking, comments come in 2 forms: leading and trailing.

**Leading comments**

Leading comments can be used everywhere.

```protobuf
/**
 * This is a leading comment for a message
 */
message SomeMessage {
  // this is another leading comment
  string value = 1;
}
```

> NOTE: File level comments should be leading comments on the syntax directive.

**Trailing comments**

Fields, Service Methods, Enum Values and Extensions support trailing comments.

```protobuf
enum MyEnum {
  DEFAULT = 0; // the default value
  OTHER   = 1; // the other value
}
```

**Excluding comments**

If you want to have some comment in your proto files, but don't want them to be part of the docs, you can simply prefix
the comment with `@exclude`. 

Example: include only the comment for the `id` field

```protobuf
/**
 * @exclude
 * This comment won't be rendered
 */
message ExcludedMessage {
  string id   = 1; // the id of this message.
  string name = 2; // @exclude the name of this message

  /* @exclude the value of this message. */
  int32 value = 3;
}
```
